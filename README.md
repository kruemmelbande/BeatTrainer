# BeatReader  
My attemt at reading Beatsaber maps and visualize them.

It only supports v3 beatmaps, however, a v2 to v3 converter is included.  
This converter will overwrite your original beatmap, so use with extreme caution (HAVE A BACKUP!)  
The converter is not intended to be used with beatsaber, but only this visualizer.  
Beatmapps converted with this might work with beatsaber, however some map events are not supported.

## Installation

Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Copy one beatmap into the beatmap folder and run `python main.py`.
The visualizer doesnt officially support beatmaps with different difficulties, however, one of the difficulties will be loaded.
